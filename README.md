### 📎 Following The Structure

###### ◽ src/main/.../api
- Interfaces for various services are located in `api` package.
- If there is a need to define something with an interface, it should be located in `api` package.

###### ◽ src/main/.../common
- Common use classes that are not services, ui or models are located in `common` package.
- This is a place for utilities, handlers, extensions, etc.

###### ◽ src/main/.../di
- Binding modules for dependency injection are located in `di` package.
- Each module is located in a separate file.
- Prefer bindings over providing instances directly.

###### ◽ src/main/.../model
- Data models are located in `model` package.
- Each model is located in a grouped by its use file. i.e. `Task.kt` could hold `Task`
  and `TaskMeal` models.

###### ◽ src/main/.../ui
- `Composable` functions (later on: `Components`) are used to build the UI.
- `Screen` is just a component that is used to build the UI out of other components.
- Screen components are located in `ui.screen` package.
- Each screen has its own `Screen` component and `ViewModel` if required.
- Components specific to a screen are located in the same file as the screen component.
- Components that are not specific to a screen are located in `ui.common` package, grouped by their
  use. i.e. `Texts.kt`, `Buttons.kt`, etc.
- `Router` is used to define routes to screens.

###### ◽ src/main/.../worker
- Background workers are located in `worker` package.
- Each worker is located in a separate file.
- Workers are used to perform background tasks.

###### ◽ src/main/res
- Resources are located in `res` directory.
- `src/main/res/values/strings.xml` is used to define strings used in the application.

### ✒️ Code Style
- [Kotlin Style Guide](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide)
- Remember to always
  - Remove any unnecessary comments, empty lines, imports and whitespace
  - Use `val` instead of `var` whenever possible
  - Use `when` instead of `if` whenever possible
  - Use brackets for `if`, `for` and `while` blocks even if they are not required
    - Exception for `if`: conditionals that are in a single line
  - Use simple yet well defined names for variables, functions, classes, etc.
